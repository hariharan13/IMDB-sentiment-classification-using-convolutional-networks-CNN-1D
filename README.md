This program ,  use the Keras IMDB movie review sentiment data, which has labeled its sentiment (positive/negative).
Reviews are pre-processed, and each review is already encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers).
Major steps:
Pre-processing, during this stage, we do pad sequences to bring all observations into one fixed dimension, which enhances speed and enables computation
CNN 1D model development and validation
Model evaluation
